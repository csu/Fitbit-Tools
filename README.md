SleepDebt
=========

Calculates sleep debt using sleep records from the Fitbit API

### Todo
* Create REST API for accessing sleep over a list of dates and calculating differences in goal total and real total sleep times
* Create GUI in flask or something to easily view statistics in a web browser
* Add more options for the date range to use
* Allow for more precise goals (minute precision)
